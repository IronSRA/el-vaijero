## About The Project

The Traveler is the second project we have carried out during [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/) Full Stack Web Dev Bootcamp. Team work: Sergio Collado, Roberto Marrero and Alejandro Garc√≠a.

### Built With üõ†

## Getting Started ‚å®Ô∏è

The page has a city search engine, which allows users to obtain:

- Basic country information.
- Climate information.
- Points of tourist interest.
- Restaurants.
- Events.
- News.

It also allows travllers to join a social community where they contact other users who are in the same city to set up plans.
